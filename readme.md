This Repository consists of both the Maltese Street Garbage Dataset and Object detection models

The unprocessed dataset can be found in the 'dataset' directory. A python notebook is included to aid dataset visualisation. A python script "Aggregate_Dataset.py" is also provided to aggregate the subfolders into a single structure with
the subfolders being the class labels.

The annotated dataset can be found on Roboflow at https://app.roboflow.com/ari3129-garbage-detection-dataset-cv-project/garbage-detection-alq27/4
